Discussion -1- ............ Done. 
Thank you, my hero. But there are some points you have to notice:
                          - First of all, regarding your answer about the MAMP by default, we couldn't install it with Windows O.S but with the latest update for MAMP we could install it with Windows O.S
                          - The answer about the last equation was brief and not enough so you need to search more about it.
